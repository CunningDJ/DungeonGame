# DungeonGame

First version developed for Windows.  Plan to add other OS functionality.

An animated, multithreaded command line game where up to three players (represented by numbers) run from a monster (represented by 'M') for as long as they can survive. 

Also, you can choose between 'looped' and solid wall. Designed for Windows. 

For the first version, the monster simply speeds up by 5% every 7 seconds, but I'll probably set it to asymptotally approach some difficult speed for following versions.

Controls:
Ctrl-C to quit.  ESC has a thread locking bug at the moment.
Player 1: Arrow keys 
Player 2: WASD 
Player 3: IJKL
